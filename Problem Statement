 Analysis of FIR using AI/ML for proper Act and Section

Problem Statement:
Design and develop a software/portal to assist law enforcement in accurately and comprehensively drafting First Information Reports (FIRs) using advanced NLP, machine learning, and structured data representation.
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Textual complaints from complainants (written/recorded), evidence photos.
Language identification, OCR for handwritten complaints (initially in Hindi/English), picture-to-text conversion, and text normalization are among the preprocessing techniques used.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Event Classification: Sorting complaints according to FIR classifications (such as theft and assault).
Identification of activities/Crimes: The identification of certain activities and possible crimes described.
Structured Data Representation
Putting information that has been extracted into structured formats (like JSON or XML).
Mapping: Linking applicable IPC sections and legal provisions to entities and actions.
State-specific regulations and regional variances should be incorporated for proper reporting.
AI/ML Model
Predict pertinent IPC sections using context and information that has been gathered.
Provide the officer with suggestions for further sections to review.
Gain more completeness and accuracy over time by learning.
User Interface and Interaction
Interface: An officer-friendly interface for entering the details of complaints.
Display: Presenting entities that have been detected, extracted data, and possible IPC sections.
Modification: Permitting officers to add more information, edit, or validate portions.
Draft Generation: Using user input and structured data, a draft FIR is created.

Integration and Reporting
CCTNS Integration: Data sharing and record-keeping are seamlessly integrated with CCTNS.
